Gone are the days of image heavy design just to include a custom typeface and techniques like SIFR and Cufon have rightly been retired. With a few lines of CSS or javascript any typeface can be added to a page.</p> <p>Nevertheless if you are not a designer the ins and outs of typography can be daunting. From x-heights to ascenders, stems to bowls, discretionary ligatures to stylistic sets the terminology alone is confusing enough.</p> <p>In this talk Justin will run through a basic introduction to typography concepts, a short history of type on the web and then demonstrate some advanced techniques for creating beautiful web typography.</p> <p> </p> <p>The talk will start at 7pm.

His product Easy2Map (which offers users a code-free solution for creating functional and beautiful maps) was the initial idea that received funding and incubation. </p> <p>However, after the ubiquitous 'pivot' that came after advice from the program's mentors, a new product called MyDoorHandle was devised. MyDoorHandle simplifies address systems by replacing latitudes and longitudes with an easy to remember name or \u2018handle\u2019. </p> <p>Both products focus heavily on maps and location-based functionality. In this talk, Steve relays some of tips and observations on various topics of relating to online maps, mobile-first applications, and how to design and develop specifically for emerging markets.</p> <p>Steven will start his talk at 7pm. Doors open at 6:30pm - join us for a drink before the talk.</p> <p><b>Breakdown of talk</b></p> <p>\u2022 Comparison of Google Maps and OpenStreetMap</p> <p>\u2022 Developing mobile-first websites and apps for emerging markets - some lessons learnt</p> <p>\u2022 The importance of design - lessons from Silicon Valley</p> <p>\u2022 Is Twitter Bootstrap 3 the silver bullet for responsive website development?</p> <p>\u2022 Getting the best performance out of a website - tips and tricks</p> <p>\u2022 Device testing with mobile-first development - how important is it?</p> <p>\u2022 MyDoorHandle - product overview, application of some of the features discussed.</p> <p><b>About Steven</b></p> <p>Steven comes from Cape Town and has 13 years development experience. He has a marketing honours degree from UCT, and got into programming only after graduating (when he tried to develop his own personal website and realized how strangely addictive this programming was).</p> <p>Having focused primarily on web development during his career, he has seen the inevitable swing of the web towards mobile, and now focuses most of his attention on developing mobile-first applications. Easy2Map and MyDoorHandle are his first startup ventures.</p> <p><b>About our sponsors</b></p> <p>Thanks to:</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://friendsofdesign.net/\">Friends of Design</a> for the fantastic venue;</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://newmedialabs.co.za/\">New Media Labs</a> for sponsoring drinks.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"photo_album":{"id":18692482,"title":"Lessons from an IT startup: mobile, maps and more","photo_count":1,"photo_sample":[{"id":309036722,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/7/2/highres_309036722.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/7/2/600_309036722.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/7/2/thumb_309036722.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}]}},{"created":1384336503000,"id":"150662682","name":"'CSS Off' nerdery","rsvp_limit":15,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1386174600000,"local_date":"2013-12-04","local_time":"18:30","updated":1386232466000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"venue":{"id":7760612,"name":"Rick's Cafe Americain","lat":-33.92839813232422,"lon":18.41053009033203,"repinned":false,"address_1":"2 Park Road","city":"Gardens","country":"za","localized_country_name":"South Africa"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1351246477000,"name":"Front-end Development South Africa (FEDSA)","id":5568472,"join_mode":"open","lat":-33.93000030517578,"lon":18.459999084472656,"urlname":"fedsa-community","who":"members","localized_location":"Cape Town, South Africa","state":"","country":"za","region":"en_US","timezone":"Africa/Johannesburg"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/events/150662682/","manual_attendance_count":8,"description":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff\">CSS Off</a> competition started yesterday, the 12th of November.<br/>Entries are open until the 26th of November.</p> <p>So, instead of a formal December meetup, let's get together to share our CSS Off entries.</p> <p>If you want to attend, you should take part in the competition, so that we all have the required experience and reference.</p> <p>We're going to aim for 15 people, but we can expand the requirements to suit a bigger group or break off into smaller groups.

In particular, we\u2019re going to focus on accessibility, just in time for <a href=\"http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/\">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a>.</p> <p><b>About the Global Accessibility Awareness Day</b></p> <p>The purpose of GAAD is to get people talking, thinking and learning about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) accessibility and users with different disabilities.</p> <p>The target audience of Global Accessibility Awareness Day is the design, development, usability, and related communities who build, shape, fund and influence technology and its use. While people may be interested in the topic of making technology accessible and usable by persons with disabilities, the reality is that they often do not know how or where to start. Awareness comes first. </p> <p><b>Your stuff</b></p> <p>For the first half of the workshop we\u2019re going to look at making our own stuff more accessible. We\u2019ll work through some practical examples and then apply the ideas to our own projects. That means things like:</p> <p>\u2022  making sure all images have alt tags;</p> <p>\u2022 using the new stuctural HTML5 elements like section, article, header, footer, and nav;</p> <p>\u2022 using ARIA roles to help guide users through a page, and more.</p> <p><b>Other people\u2019s stuff</b></p> <p>For the second half of the workshop we\u2019re going to discuss helping our friends and colleagues learn about accessibility and understand why it\u2019s important. We\u2019ll put together some ideas for what we can all do at our places of work on GAAD, based on the <a href=\"http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html\">GAAD participation activities</a>. That means things like:</p> <p>\u2022 going mouseless for an hour;</p> <p>\u2022 enlarging our default browser font size;</p> <p>\u2022 checking for sufficient colour contrast.</p> <p>We\u2019ll also talk about how to convince people to take part in these activities!</p> <p><b>About the facilitators</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/a/5/600_448892165.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Justin Slack</b> is head of design, user experience, and front-end development at <a href=\"http://newmedialabs.co.za/\">New Media Labs</a>.

We're running our annual weekend workshop just before the day itself :)</p> <p>**About the workshop**</p> <p>We've dramatically revamped the workshop to give you more time testing and tweaking your stuff. We've expanded and revised the GAAD activities to include more tests of more things, grouped into themed categories. We've got more ways of talking about a wider definition of disability and of making a case for adopting Inclusive Design as an awesome way to build things for the web.</p> <p>During the workshop you'll test your work, makes some small changes that'll make a big difference, and learn from the other attendees. As you leave, you'll have plans for what to do next, and some ideas about what to do yourself on Global Accessibility Awareness Day on Thursday May 17.</p> <p>**About you**</p> <p>\u2022 You'll need a web site to use for the workshop. This could be from work, a side project, or something brand new.<br/>\u2022 You should be familiar with HTML and CSS. A little knowledge of JavaScript will be useful, but isn't required.<br/>\u2022 You're interested in making your web stuff work for more people.<br/>\u2022 If you have one, bring your laptop, charger, and a pair of headphones.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Header pic from the excellent Inclusive Design at Microsoft: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive</a></p> <p>--</p> <p>Attendees must read and follow our Code of Conduct ( <a href=\"http://ctfeds.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">http://ctfeds.org/code-of-conduct/</a> ).

From tables, to floats, positioning, and display properties, these techniques have all had one thing in common: they are by and large hacks.</p> <p>As a result design on the web has been difficult because of a lack of real tools for creating layouts. With the advent of Flexbox and latterly CSS Grid, we are finally getting tools to do design on the web. Join us for an afternoon exploring CSS Grid layouts.</p> <p>---</p> <p>About the facilitator</p> <p>Justin Slack is head of design, user experience, and front-end development at NML (<a href=\"https://nml.co.za\" class=\"linkified\">https://nml.co.za</a>).

As a result we have decided to close RSVPs.</p> <p>If you are already on the waiting list you still have a chance of attending if any current attendees drop out.</p> <p>Because of the great interest in the topic we will run it again in the near future.</p> <p>❓ About the course<br/>-------------------<br/>Webpack, Babel and TypeScript, Oh My!</p> <p>After 16 years of stagnation and false starts, there has been a sudden surge over the last 3 years of exciting updates to the JavaScript language and eco-system. However, despite all the fanfare, for some this torrent of activity more closely resemble a tidal-wave, well on its way to crushing the JavaScript they know.</p> <p>I've you're feeling overwhelmed by all the new developments in the world of JavaScript, this is your opportunity to get up to speed, and leave with a live ES6 site that you can put in your portfolio/CV.</p> <p>⏰ Schedule<br/>-------------------<br/>Event runs from 10:00 to 17:00 (with a lunch break between 13:00 - 14:00) at Codebridge (loads of free parking). There is a Pick 'n Pay and Woolworths Food across the road, and the Cavendish shopping center is also within walking distance.</p> <p>However, you are more than welcome to bring your own snacks/beer/etc. We will also be doing toasted sandwiches in the oven at 13:00 for those that are keen. There will also be a coffee maker, tea and rusks to keep you going through the day.</p> <p>🎁 Content<br/>-------------------<br/>We will start by unpacking some core ES6 concepts, with live coding examples. Attendees will then proceed by building their own ES6 micro-site (similar to <a href=\"https://humans-in-space.netlify.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://humans-in-space.netlify.com</a>) with help from the facilitators and fellow attendees.</p> <p>The agenda for the day is as follows:</p> <p>1. What is ES6?</p> <p>2. The History of JavaScript</p> <p>3. Why ES6 is a huge deal</p> <p>4. The future of JavaScript after ES6</p> <p>5. What are the following, and why/when do we need them:<br/>- Syntax transpilers (Babel, Google Traceur, etc.)<br/>- Polyfills (Core JS, Babel Polyfill, etc.)<br/>- Module Resolvers (Webpack, Rollup, etc.)<br/>- JavaScipt super-set languages (TypeScript, Clojure, etc.)</p> <p>6. Key ES6 changes to JavaScript:<br/>- Strings and template literals.<br/>- New const and let variables.<br/>- The new arrow function.<br/>- Changes to arrays and objects.<br/>- Loops and generators.<br/>- Classes and symbols.<br/>- Promises and a new way to do AJAX.<br/>- ES Modules.</p> <p>7. Attendees to build one of either micro-site:<br/>- A site that dynamically generates either a Chuck Norris joke or a random inspirational quote by using <a href=\"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random\" class=\"linkified\">https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random</a> or <a href=\"https://quotesondesign.com/wp-json/posts\" class=\"linkified\">https://quotesondesign.com/wp-json/posts</a>?.<br/>- An interactive site that displays and allow user to compare data from SpaceX launches: <a href=\"https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches\" class=\"linkified\">https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches</a>.</p> <p>👽 Facilitators<br/>-------------------<br/>Schalk is a frontend developer/designer that works for a civic-tech non-profit called OpenUp (<a href=\"https://openup.org.za/\" class=\"linkified\">https://openup.org.za/</a>).

Luckily, it is also possible to use GraphQL without adding a single JavaScript library.</p> <p>💡 Shailen Naidoo<br/>Building a VS Code extension that is actually useful - Netlify for VS Code</p> <p>Ever thought of building a VS Code extension? After getting tired of hoping back and forth between VS Code and the Netlify site just to check my build status, I finally found a reason to build one. Find out how I did it and how you can do it too.</p> <p>💡 Dane Rossenrode<br/>From Drupal to an Angular, and falling in love with TypeScript along the way</p> <p>For the past few years I've been building websites using CMSs like Drupal, but I've recently jumped into the world of front-end frameworks with my first web app built in Angular. It's basically an open-source clone of Google Sites, but it can save data to any CMS backend. I can't wait to show you.</p> <p>💡 Amo Moloko<br/>My Experience With Serverless GraphQL</p> <p>This lighting talk is about how I shipped my first project at Pimp My Book<br/>using GraphQL on AWS Lambda and it's other services.</p> <p>💡 Adam Meier<br/>Manipulating YouTube videos with the YouTube Iframe Player and Web browser APIs, and how to build an app for that</p> <p>We'll look at how I am building a React app to select segments of a YouTube video, and set them to play sequentially or loop endlessly, and at any desired playback speed.</p> <p>I'll also go over the various new things I learned whilst taking on this task, such as how to set up a Webpack configuration from scratch, and the uses of Typescript, and why it works so well with React, Redux, and the React Hooks API.</p> <p>💡 Justin Slack<br/>Everything you always wanted to know about lists but were afraid to ask</p> <p>We\u2019ve all created lists in HTML at some point. Browsers automatically style these and we haven\u2019t been able to do much about that. Until now.

Engineers must instead re-create surfaces from scratch, by hand, using code (often heavily using tools like the Devtools CSS inspector, the closest thing engineers have to a design tool). This inevitably leads to discrepancies and back-and-forth with the design team, and ultimately two sources of truth that are never truly in sync.</p> <p>Plasmic is a tool to build production UIs visually, intended to help bridge this divide. It loosely resembles a design tool and aims to give the same sense of speedy iteration, but is for building maintainable, production-ready presentational components. The idea is to give developers a better and faster development experience, eliminate an entire class of visual bugs/QA/tooling, and ultimately maintain a single source of truth with design. This talk will also cover some of the challenges with building such a tool (which itself is a React application).</p> <p>👽 Speaker<br/>-------------------<br/>Yang had an early career in distributed DBs and ML, but developed a love for frontend.
